## Protocol Summary
The Self-Inheritance Protocol is a comprehensive system for creating secure, multi-generational Bitcoin vaults using multi-signature wallets. It enables individuals to establish trustless inheritance systems without relying on third parties.

This protocol helps you create a 3-of-5 multi-signature Bitcoin vault where:
- 5 Seeds are distributed among 4 guardians and yourself
- 1 Passphrase is shared between 2 heirs and yourself
- Only by combining Seeds with the Passphrase can funds be accessed
- Recovery requires cooperation between guardians and heirs

## Core Principles
1. **Trustless Operation**: No reliance on third parties
2. **Security First**: Air-gapped operations, multiple backups
3. **Future Proof**: Designed for long-term storage
4. **Self Sovereign**: Complete control over your Bitcoin
5. **Verifiable**: All steps include verification procedures
