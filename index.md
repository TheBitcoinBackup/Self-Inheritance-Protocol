## Protocol Summary
The Self-Inheritance Protocol is a comprehensive system for creating secure, multi-generational Bitcoin vaults using multi-signature wallets. It enables individuals to establish trustless inheritance systems without relying on third parties.

This protocol helps you create a 3-of-5 multi-signature Bitcoin vault where:
- 5 Seeds are distributed among 4 guardians and yourself
- 1 Passphrase is shared between 2 heirs and yourself
- Only by combining Seeds with the Passphrase can funds be accessed
- Recovery requires cooperation between guardians and heirs

## Who This Protocol Is For

This protocol is designed for Bitcoiners who:
- Have a family and want to ensure generational wealth transfer
- Prioritize secure inheritance of their bitcoin holdings
- Need a solution that doesn't require heirs to be Bitcoin experts
- Are willing to involve trusted family members as guardians
- Value self-custody and want to avoid third-party services
- Seek a robust, time-tested approach to inheritance

The Self-Inheritance Protocol provides a structured way to ensure your bitcoin passes to your heirs while maintaining security through a network of trusted family members acting as guardians.

## Core Principles
1. **Trustless Operation**: No reliance on third parties
2. **Security First**: Air-gapped operations, multiple backups
3. **Future Proof**: Designed for long-term storage
4. **Self Sovereign**: Complete control over your Bitcoin
5. **Verifiable**: All steps include verification procedures
