### Assembly Process

#### Prepare Envelopes
```
Label each envelope:
- Black: "Seed 1" through "Seed 5"
- Red: "Passphrase"
- Orange: "Wallet Descriptor"
- Green: "Recovery Instructions"
- Violet: "Signing Device"
```

#### Package Assembly
```
1. Verify contents match checklists
2. Insert materials into appropriate envelopes
3. Seal envelopes
4. Label outer package:
   "Property of [OWNER]
    Protected by [GUARDIAN/HEIR NAME]
    at [LOCATION]
    DO NOT OPEN without [OWNER]'s permission
    If moved, alert [OWNER] immediately"
```

### Distribution

#### Security Considerations
```
For Local Distribution:
1. Deliver packages personally
2. Explain basic responsibilities
3. Verify storage location
4. Document distribution

For International Distribution:
1. Consider metal backup creation at destination
2. Travel with paper backups only
3. Create metal backups upon arrival
4. Complete package assembly on-site
```

## Security Considerations

### Critical Security Points
1. **Workspace Security**
   - Private, lockable room
   - Separate online/offline areas
   - No cameras in offline area
   - Secure storage when paused

2. **Key Generation Security**
   - Use casino-grade dice only
   - 50 dice rolls per seed/passphrase
   - Never digitize seeds or passphrase
   - Clear devices after each use

3. **Backup Security**
   - Verify all backups immediately
   - Test QR codes scan correctly
   - Confirm fingerprints match
   - Destroy temporary materials

4. **Distribution Security**
   - Personal delivery only
   - No shipping services
   - Consider airport security with metal backups
   - Verify recipient understanding

### International Transport Notes
- Metal backups will raise security concerns at airports
- Consider creating metal backups at destination
- Travel with paper backups only when crossing borders
- Local metal backup creation recommended
