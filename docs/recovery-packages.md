### Assembly Process

#### Prepare Envelopes
```
Label each envelope:
- Black: "Seed 1" through "Seed 5"
- Red: "Passphrase"
- Orange: "Wallet Descriptor"
- Green: "Recovery Instructions"
- Violet: "Signing Device"
```

#### Package Assembly
```
1. Verify contents match checklists
2. Insert materials into appropriate envelopes
3. Seal envelopes
4. Label outer package:
   "Property of [OWNER]
    Protected by [GUARDIAN/HEIR NAME]
    at [LOCATION]
    DO NOT OPEN without [OWNER]'s permission
    If moved, alert [OWNER] immediately"
```

### Distribution

#### Security Considerations
```
For Local Distribution:
1. Deliver packages personally
2. Explain basic responsibilities
3. Verify storage location
4. Document distribution

For International Distribution:
1. Consider metal backup creation at destination
2. Travel with paper backups only
3. Create metal backups upon arrival
4. Complete package assembly on-site
```

#### International Transport Notes
- Metal backups will raise security concerns at airports
- Consider creating metal backups at destination
- Travel with paper backups only when crossing borders
- Local metal backup creation recommended
