This diagram shows how a Seed alone becomes a different Signing Key when combined with a Passphrase.

#### Required Materials

- Casino dice
- Power bank
- Temporary paper
- Permanent marker
- Graph paper for QR codes

#### Generate Each Seed
```
For each of the 5 Seeds:

1. Power on Seedsigner
2. Select "New Seed"
3. Input 50 dice rolls
4. Record temporarily:
   - Label ("Seed 1", "Seed 2", etc.)
   - 12 words
   - Fingerprint without passphrase

5. Verify Seed:
   - Delete seed from device
   - Re-enter 12 words
   - Confirm fingerprint matches

6. Create final backups:
   - Write on paper stock
   - Create QR code on graph paper
   - Mark both with "Seed X"
```

### Passphrase Generation

#### Generation Steps
```
1. Power on Seedsigner
2. Select "New Seed"
3. Input 50 dice rolls
4. Record:
   - Label as "Passphrase"

3. Record on paper backup:
   - "Fingerprint with passphrase"

4. Clear device
5. Verify:
   - Reload Seed and Passphrase
