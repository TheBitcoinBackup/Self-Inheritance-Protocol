## Overview
This section covers the generation of:
- 5 Seeds (for guardians + owner)
- 1 Passphrase (for heirs + owner)
- Final verification of all keys

## Important Security Notes
- Perform all operations in offline area
- Keep seeds and passphrase away from cameras/phones
- Clear signing device after each operation

   - 12 words
   - Fingerprint without passphrase

5. Verify Seed:
   - Delete seed from device
   - Re-enter 12 words
   - Confirm fingerprint matches

6. Create final backups:
   - Write on paper stock
   - Create QR code on graph paper
   - Mark both with "Seed X"
```

### QR Code Testing
```
For each Seed:

1. Delete seed from device
2. Scan Seed QR code
3. Verify fingerprint matches
4. Clear device
```

## Passphrase Generation

### Generate Passphrase
```
1. Power on Seedsigner
2. Select "New Seed"
3. Input 50 dice rolls
4. Record:

4. Clear device
```

### Verification
```
For each Seed + Passphrase combination:

1. Scan Seed QR
2. Enter passphrase
