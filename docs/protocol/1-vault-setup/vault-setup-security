# Security Considerations and Procedures

## Workspace Security

### Physical Setup
- Dedicated, private room with lockable door
- Separate online and offline work areas
  - Online: For following course videos and wallet interface
  - Offline: For handling Seeds, Passphrase, and backups
- No cameras pointed at offline workspace
- Secure storage when work is paused

### Data Handling
- Never digitize Seeds or Passphrase
- No photographs of sensitive information
- Keep Seeds and Passphrase in offline area only
- Destroy temporary backup materials by burning

## Key Generation Security

### Entropy Generation
- Use casino-grade dice only
- 50 dice rolls per seed/passphrase
- Input entropy into signing device
- Never use digital random number generators

### Device Security
- Keep signing device offline at all times
- Use only for key operations
- Clear device memory after each use
- Verify fingerprints match after operations

## Recovery Package Security

### Package Creation
- Work in clean, private space
- Verify all materials before sealing
- Use colored envelopes for clear organization:
  - Black: Seeds
  - Red: Passphrase
  - Orange: Wallet Descriptor
  - Green: Recovery Instructions
  - Violet: Signing Device

### Distribution Considerations
- Personal delivery recommended
- For international distribution:
  - Consider airport security with metal backups
  - Create metal backups at destination if needed
- Ensure guardians understand storage importance
- Mark packages clearly with ownership and storage location

## Guardian and Heir Guidelines

### Guardian Selection
- Property owners preferred (stable location)
- Understands importance of package security
- Willing to protect package long-term
- Can be trusted not to open package without permission

### Heir Preparation
- Basic understanding of Bitcoin helpful
- Will receive complete recovery instructions
- Should understand importance of Passphrase security
- Will receive signing device for future use

## Next Steps
1. Review workspace requirements
2. Set up dedicated areas
3. Gather required materials
4. Begin key generation process
5. Proceed to hardware preparation
